I am a researcher with a PhD in Electrical Engineering and a strong background in math and physics. On a daily basis, for the past 9 years, I have been handling a large number of diverse  datasets to provide data driven visualized insights for a variety of research projects. 

Currently I'm actively seeking for career opportunities in data analytics.
